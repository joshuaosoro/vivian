## Introduction

### Background of the Study

UHC is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This goal is motivated by the need to make healthcare affordable to all based on need and not the ability to afford it @who2010world. Consequently, the available health financing models have direct implications on the ability of the poor and vulnerable to afford healthcare.

According to @ifeagwu2021health, OOP and NHI are among the top health financing mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa. OOP, as a financing model, exposes the poor and vulnerable like teenagers to major challenges; the leading being the fact that teenagers are mostly not employed as they have not attained the age of majority, 18 years, which can allow them to legally and meaningfully get employed. Consequently, teenagers face challenges when it comes to relying on OOP as a health financing mechanism mainly because they don't have the money to spend on their healthcare.

The other major health financing model, NHI, is run by SHIF. Previously called NHIF, SHIF established the Linda Mama Scheme with the principal aim of ensuring universal access to free maternity services for expectant mothers throughout pregnancy and childbirth and thus catering to the poor and vulnerable @orangi2021examining.

However, Linda mama has faced various challenges as elucidated by @orangi2021examining; key among them: the lack of knowledge about Linda mama among those seeking services and also healthcare service providers thus necessitating the need to improve communication of the program to health facilities using circulars and also to beneficiaries using regular health talks. @orangi2021examining also noted the need to monitor health facilities to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not asked for any user fees when seeking Linda mama services.

### Statement of the Problem

@ifeagwu2021health found that OOP, Donor funding and NHI are respectively the top three health financing mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa. Teenage mothers, being young, are vulnerable and thus deserve special attention to ascertain that they are able to access medication in Siaya county.

### Research Objectives

### Research Questions

1.  How do health financing models affect the use of maternal health services by expectant teenage mothers in Siaya County?
2.  What is the impact of health financing on accessibility of maternal healthcare for expectant teenage mothers in Siaya County?
3.  In what ways does the health financing framework influence expectant teenage mothers' utilization of health facilities in Siaya County?
4.  Which are the most popular health financing models in Siaya County?

### Scope of the Study

This study will be carried out in the County of Siaya which comprises of six sub-counties: Alego, Usonga, Bondo, Ugenya, Ugunja, Gem and Rarieda.

### Justification for the study.

@KDHS2014 reported that in Siaya county, 17.2% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing. At the time, this figure was way higher compared to most of the other counties in Kenya. In the @KDHS2022 survey, it was reported that 20.9% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing; this of course was an increase compared to the previous report thus bringing to the fore the need to ensure that teenage mothers are able to access conventional medication in Siaya county.

The Linda mama program, a flagship policy initiative aimed at improving maternal health outcomes by providing free maternity services has faced implementation challenges as pointed out by @orangi2021examining. This study therefore holds significant importance for various stakeholders in the healthcare sector. Firstly, it will directly address the gap between policy formulation and implementation, providing insights that can inform future health financing policies. Secondly, while existing literature acknowledges the challenges in maternal healthcare access, there is a lack of specific research focusing on the experiences of expectant teenage mothers particularly in light of a growing trend of teenage mothers in Siaya County as compared to other counties.

By focusing on teenage mothers, this study will fill an empirical gap in the literature. Moreover, the findings from this study will directly inform policy decisions aimed at improving maternal healthcare access and consequently outcomes in Kenya. By identifying the specific barriers faced by expectant teenage mothers and evaluating the effectiveness of different health financing models, the study will enable policymakers to design more targetted interventions to address these challenges and advance the goal of achieving universal health coverage.
