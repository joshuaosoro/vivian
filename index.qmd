## Introduction

### 1.1 Background to the Study

UHC, as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is motivated by the need to make healthcare affordable to all based on need and not the ability to afford it @who2010world. Consequently, the available health financing models have direct implications on the ability of the poor and vulnerable to afford healthcare.

According to @ifeagwu2021health, OOP and NHI are among the top health financing mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa. OOP, as a financing model, exposes the poor and vulnerable like teenagers to major challenges; the leading being the fact that teenagers are mostly not employed as they have not attained the age of majority, 18 years, which can allow them to legally and meaningfully get employed. @salari2019catastrophic established that the average OOP payment was Ksh 5613 for outpatient treatments, Ksh 1492 for inpatient treatments and Ksh 7990 for both types of treatment; all of these figures are way beyond the financial capability of most teenagers in Siaya County. Consequently, teenagers face challenges when it comes to relying on OOP as a health financing mechanism mainly because they don't have the money to spend on their healthcare.

The other major health financing model, NHI, is run by SHIF. Previously called NHIF, SHIF established the Linda Mama Scheme with the principal aim of ensuring universal access to free maternity services for expectant mothers throughout pregnancy and childbirth and thus catering to the poor and vulnerable @orangi2021examining. While @comfort2013effect noted that there is a positive correlation between health insurance and access to maternal health services, existing literature doesn't provide such evidence in the context of Siaya County. Also, @kamano2022awareness notes that in selected counties of Western Kenya, Siaya being one of them, there was a low NHIF uptake rate of between 21 - 25 %. The study also noted that one of the reasons for the low uptake was low level of education and low income status, which is a challenge that mainly affects teenagers since they are not meaningfully employable and besides have a low level of education.

In a bid to ensure universal access to maternal health services, the government introduced Linda Mama under the NHIF, which is a free health financing strategy exclusively targeting mothers and their newborns who cannot afford any cover including NHIF. However, Linda mama has faced various challenges as outlined by @orangi2021examining; key among them: the lack of knowledge about Linda mama among those seeking services and also healthcare service providers thus necessitating the need to improve communication of the program to health facilities using circulars and also to beneficiaries using regular health talks. @orangi2021examining also noted the need to monitor health facilities to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not asked for any user fees when seeking Linda mama services.

### 1.2 Statement of the Problem

### Problem statement

@KDHS2022 survey, reported that 20.9% of the girls in Siaya County between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing, a proportion higher than most counties in the country. This development comes against a backdrop of declining level of access to healthcare financing schemes in Siaya County @lukoritohouseholds thus necessitating the need to investigate how expectant teenage mothers in access to conventional medication has been affected.

While the literature review reveals that other studies have looked at the impact that health financing models have had on access conventional medication, special attention has not been given to Siaya County considering the fact that it bears a heavy burden when it comes to teenage pregnancy compared to other counties in the country.

Therefore, this study was conceived to look at how expectant teenage mothers as a vulnerable group in Siaya County have been affected in terms of access to conventional medication using various available schemes: public, private or community-based healthcare financing schemes.

### 1.3 Research Questions

1.  How does the health financing model influence expectant teenage mothers' access to conventional medication in Siaya County?

2.  How does access to conventional medication improve maternal health in Siaya County?

### 1.4 Main Objective

The main objective was to investigate the influence of different health financing models on expectant teenage mothers' access to conventional medication in Siaya County.

### 1.5 Objectives of the study

1.  To investigate how health financing model influence expectant teenage mothersâ€™ access to conventional medication in Siaya County.

2.  To establish how access to conventional medication improves maternal health in Siaya County.

### 1.6 Scope of the Study

This study will be carried out in the County of Siaya which comprises of six sub-counties: Alego Usonga, Bondo, Ugenya, Ugunja, Gem and Rarieda.

### 1.7 Justification for the study.

The effectiveness of health financing models need to be investigated when it comes to providing coverage for expectant teenage mothers as a vulnerable group in accessing conventional medication.

NHIF, a public health financing scheme established the Linda mama program, a flagship policy initiative aimed at improving maternal healthcare access. This initiative has however faced challenges in its implementation potentially hindering expectant teenage mothers from accessing healthcare as pointed out by @orangi2021examining. Currently under NHIF, Linda mama is in the process of transitioning to SHIF. However, the new UHC rules do not explicitly indicate the fate of Linda mama under SHIF, a development which could hinder expectant teenage mother from effectively accessing conventional medication.

As @lukoritohouseholds established private and community based financing healthcare models in Siaya County only cover less 2% of the population. This stems from the fact that the economy of Siaya is mostly informal. Besides, Siaya County is mostly a rural county and thus the poverty levels are high, hence the low enrollment into the various healthcare financing models. This factor potentially puts expectant teenage mothers at risk of not being able to access conventional medication.

These concerns therefore underscores the need to investigate how the various healthcare financing models: public (NHIF and its initiatives); private and community based healthcare financing schemes influence expectant teenage mothers' access to conventional medication in Siaya County. This study therefore holds significant importance for various stakeholders in the healthcare sector because it will directly address the gap between policy formulation and implementation, providing insights that can inform future health financing policies and initiatives.

Besides, while existing literature acknowledges the challenges in maternal healthcare access, there is a lack of specific research focusing on the experiences of expectant teenage mothers particularly in light of a higher prevalence of teenage mothers in Siaya County as compared to other counties in Kenya: the @KDHS2022 survey reported that 20.9% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old in Siaya County had begun child bearing. This figure was way higher than most of the rest of the other counties in Kenya.

By focusing on teenage mothers, this study will fill an empirical gap in the literature. Moreover, the findings from this study will directly inform policy decisions aimed at improving maternal healthcare access and consequently outcomes in Kenya. By identifying the specific barriers faced by expectant teenage mothers and evaluating the effectiveness of different health financing models, the study will enable policymakers to design more targeted initiatives to address these challenges and advance the goal of achieving universal health coverage.

### 1.8 Theoretical Framework

Teenager: Person aged between 13 - 19 years old.

### 1.9 Conceptual Diagram

## Literature Review.

### 2.1 Introduction

This chapter establishes the state of expectant teenage mothers' access to conventional medical using various health financing models influence . We shall evaluate the impact various health financing models have on teenage mothers' access to conventional medication. We shall also look at the impact access to conventional medication has had on maternal health. One of the major barriers to access to healthcare is of course finances and therefore expectant teenage mothers are especially a vulnerable group because of the fact that they mostly don't have the capacity to afford the healthcare financing models that we have in place owing to the fact that most of them haven't attained the age of majority and are thus not employable or even eligible to start businesses.

### 2.2.1 Teenage pregnancy in context

@KDHS2014 reported that 17.2% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun childbearing while @KDHS2022 reported that 20.9% of the girls between the same age bracket in Siaya County had started childbearing. These statistics shows a growing trend of teenage pregnancy in Siaya County.

### 2.2.2 Access to conventional medication using various healthcare financing models.

@kutzin2017developing outlines the goals of universal health coverage that health financing can influence as: access to quality services; financing protection of the financially vulnerable and access to health services according to need. This is to be achieved through three key strategies including: more funds allocation to healthcare; improving efficiency and equity in use of funds; pooling of resources among other strategies.

@ncpd estimates that approximately 25% of Kenyans are covered by either public, private or community based healthcare financing schemes. This means that a significant percentage of the population still remain uncovered and are left to rely on OOP thus making healthcare inaccessible to a lot of people. @KDHS2022 survey found that NHIF, a public health insurance scheme is the commonest, covering approximately 24% of Kenyans. Private health insurance schemes on the other hand covered approximately 1% while community based insurance schemes covered less than 1% of the population. This survey also found that enrollment in health financing schemes is higher in urban communities compared to rural communities. Siaya County, being a mostly rural county would be expected to have less enrollment compared to the national average. This undoubtedly places vulnerable groups like expectant teenage mothers in Siaya County in a precarious position when it comes to accessing healthcare.

Expectedly, @lukoritohouseholds found that in Siaya County, only 16.1% of those with secondary level of education and above were enrolled into healthcare financing schemes while only 6.2% of those with primary level of education and below were enrolled. This clearly shows that in Siaya County, the use of these health financing models is significantly lower than the national average of 25%. Additionally, it is important to note that expectant teenage mothers are likely to drop out of school further reducing their chances of using the available health financing models given the correlation between level of education and enrollment into the health financing models.

### 2.2.3 Access to conventional medication **vis-Ã -vis** teenage pregnancy

While expectant teenage mothers' below the age of 18 years could be considered dependents and therefore they can access conventional medication using membership of their parents. It is important to point out that this may not always be the case. This is because some of them are may be forced out of their homes by their parents who are disappointed with their pregnancy.

### 2.3 Gaps Identified

Considering the increasing trend of teenage pregnancy prevalence in Siaya County, it is important to look at how various healthcare financing models have affected this vulnerable group's access to conventional medication in light of the challenges that they face.

### 2.4 Conclusion

The @kenya_constitution_2010 states that every Kenyan has a right to quality and affordable healthcare. This study will therefore establish how effectively the available healthcare financing models have served Kenyans, especially the vulnerable like the expectant teenage mothers. The findings of this study will inform policy by identifying any gaps that need to be addressed.

## CHAPTER THREE

### RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Introduction

### 3.2 Research Design

A research design is the overall strategy encompassing data collection and analysis to answer the research questions. @orodho2003. In this study, qualitative data collection and analysis methods are employed.

The decision to use qualitative research methods for the purposes of this study will enable the researcher to understand how health financing models influence expectant mothers' access to conventional medication in Siaya County as the respondents will be able to express the challenges that they are experiencing.

### 3.3 Study Area

Siaya County in Western Kenya has a surface area of approximately 2530 km2. The County is approximately between latitude 0Â° 26Â´ South to 0Â° 18Â´ North and longitude 33Â° 58Â´ and 34Â° 33Â´ East. Administratively, Siaya County consists of six sub-counties and thirty wards. The sub-counties of Alego Usonga, Bondo and Gem each have six wards while Rarieda, Ugenya and Ugunja sub-counties have five, four and three wards respectively.

(KNBS, 2019) census put the population of Siaya County at 993,183 people. Of those, 471669 were males while 521498 were females.

### 3.4 Study Population

The population of this study is the expectant teenage mothers in Siaya County while the unit of analysis is the expectant teenage mother in Siaya County.

### 3.4.1 Inclusion Criteria

For this study, only teenage girls who were expectant were included.

### 3.5 Sampling Techniques and Sample Size

Snowball sampling was relied on to identify expectant teenagers to be interviewed. According to @gilbert2015researching, snow ball sampling is suitable for identifying participants who in this case are shy to participate in a research study. In light of this, community health promoters, teachers and healthcare workers were enlisted to assist. These professionals provided the guidance on how to reach expectant teenage mothers. Using the snowball sampling technique, twenty expectant teenage mothers agreed to participate in the study.

After recruitment, interviews with the expectant teenage mothers were conducted were conducted in spaces where confidentiality was ensured and the participants were comfortable.

### 3.6 Validity

Cognizant of the constraints in resources the study faces, it was found imperative to rely on more than one source of information. Thus, in addition to interviews, the study also relied on secondary sources of information to make the findings valid and reliable.

### 3.7 Data Collection Techniques

The data collected was qualitative and thus relied on the following sources of information.

### 3.7.1 In-depth interviews(IDIs)

The primary technique of data collection for this study was in-depth interviews using the IDI guide that was developed for purposes of data collection. Since respondents are not limited to a pre-designed set of responses, in-depth interviews have the capacity to bring out detailed and rich information about the study question. @creswell2017research

The interviews were conducted in places that ensured confidentiality of the participants. With the consent of the study participants, the interviews were recorded for later transcription. Transcripts that needed to be translated were translated accordingly.

### 3.7.2 Key informant interviews(KIIs)

Key informant were identified. These included clinical officers and nurses. The key informants were purposively selected to include those who interacted with expectant teenagers and thus more likely to have more information on the research question. The key informants shared their views on the research question guided by a KII guide...

### 3.7.3 Secondary sources

The study also relied on secondary sources of information. These included relevant books, reports and publications related to the research questions. These materials were used to enrich the information obtained from the study findings. Some of the materials that were pivotal in this study include....

### 3.8 Data Analysis and Presentation

Since the data collected through in-depth interviews and key informant interviews was recorded in audio tapes, it was transcribed into verbatim in the language it was done. Where necessary, the data was translated from Dholuo to English.

The process of transcription was done on a rolling basis starting as soon as the first interview completed. This continued until the final interview was completed. Upon completion, thorough checking was done to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Coding and thematic analysis was done using Nvivo 12 software. Verbatim quotes from study participants were added to emphasize the findings of the study.

### 3.9 Ethical considerations

The study participants were informed about the objectives of the study. Subsequently, informed consent was obtained from all the study participants. For the study participants who were below the age of eighteen years old, written informed consent was obtained from their guardians. Voluntary participation was emphasized as the study participants were reminded that they were free to withdraw from the study at any point without facing any sort of penalties whatsoever. The study also made it clear that none of the study participant's confidentiality would be breached as the audios and subsequent information obtained would be de-linked from their identity.
