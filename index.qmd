## Introduction

### Background of the Study

According to @ifeagwu2021health, OOP, Donor funding and NHI are respectively the leading health financing mechanisms in sub-Saharan Africa.

The leading health financing mechanism in sub-Saharan Africa, OOP, faces major challenges; the leading being the fact that teenagers are mostly not employed as they have not attained the age of majority, 18 years. Consequently, teenagers face major challenges when it comes to relying on OOP as a health financing mechanism mainly because they don't have the money to spend on their healthcare.

The National Health Insurance in Kenya (SHIF), previously called NHIF, established the Linda Mama Scheme with the principal aim of ensuring universal access to free maternity services for expectant mothers throughout pregnancy and childbirth and thus catering to the poor and vulnerable @orangi2021examining.

However, Linda mama has faced various challenges as elucidated by @orangi2021examining; key among them: the need to improve communication of the program to health facilities using circulars and also to beneficiaries using regular health talks. @orangi2021examining also noted the need to monitor health facilities to ensure that the poor and vulnerable are not asked for any user fees when seeking Linda mama services.

### Statement of the Problem

@ifeagwu2021health found that OOP, Donor funding and NHI are respectively the top three health financing mechanisms.

### Scope of the Study

This study will be carried out in the County of Siaya which comprises of six sub-counties: Alego, Usonga, Bondo, Ugenya, Ugunja, Gem and Rarieda.

### Justification for the study.

@KDHS2014 reported that in Siaya county, 17.2% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing. At the time, this figure was way higher compared to most of the other counties in Kenya. In the @KDHS2022 survey, it was reported that 20.9% of the girls between the ages of 15 - 19 years old had begun child bearing; this of course was an increase compared to the previous report thus bringing to the fore the need to ensure that teenage mothers are able to access conventional medication in Siaya county.
